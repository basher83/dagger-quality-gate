# <type>: <subject>

# <body>

# <footer>

# Type should be one of the following:
# * feat (new feature)
# * fix (bug fix)
# * docs (changes to documentation)
# * style (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
# * refactor (refactoring production code)
# * test (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
# * chore (updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change)

# Subject should use impertive tone and not be capitalized or end with a period
# For example, use `add` not `added` nor `adds`

# The body should go into detail about changes made and why
# * Use imperative, present tense ("change" not "changed" nor "changes")
# * Include motivation for the change and contrasts with previous behavior

# The footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also
# the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit closes

# Breaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or
# two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

# Examples:
# feat: add support for YAML linting
# fix: correct exit code when checks fail in parallel mode
# docs: update CI integration guide with GitLab example
# refactor: extract common container setup logic
# test: add test cases for security check failures
# chore: update ruff to latest version
