# Dagger Quality Gate - Project Overview

## Purpose
Universal, reusable Dagger pipeline for running quality checks across any repository. It provides a consistent way to run linting, security scanning, type checking, and other quality checks both locally and in CI environments.

## Key Features
- Multi-language support (Python, Markdown, Terraform, etc.)
- Security scanning for vulnerabilities and exposed secrets
- Parallel execution with container isolation
- Highly configurable via environment variables
- Powered by Dagger for consistent execution
- Modern Python tooling with `uv` package manager
